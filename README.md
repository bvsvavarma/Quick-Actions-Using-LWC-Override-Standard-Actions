# Quick-Actions-Using-LWC-Override-Standard-Actions

**Quick Action**

1. A quick action can invoke a custom Lightning Web Component on record pages.
2. When it comes to record page LWC, there are 2 types: Screen Quick Actions and Headless Quick Actions.
3. When you configure a component, you can choose either to display it in a modal window, or headlessly execute its custom code.

**Screen Quick Action**

1. A screen quick action appears in a modal window.
2. Use the Lightning-quick-action-panel component for a consistent user interface.
3. To enable your component to be used a screen quick action, configure a target.
4. Unlike other components on record pages, LWC quick actions don't pass in recordId in connectedCallback(). If you need access to recordId, set the value of recordId in your code.
